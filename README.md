## Things that work: 
	* Reading button input
	* Corresponding LEDs light up when button pressed
	* Tones are played for each button
	* Checking the input and Simon sequences works

## Things that need some work:
	* Checking the input against the Simon sequence, which is determined in setup()
		* Initializing other variables in this step would be a good idea as well
	* Overall structure of functions
	* LCD display has not been incorporated yet
	* Increasing game difficulty as the sequence progresses
